# VoidHub [2.0]
===================

__A teleportation safety plugin for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, now compatible with PocketMine v5.x!__

## Introduction
VoidHub is a plugin for **[PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP)** that automatically teleports players to the world spawn when they fall below the map (Y < 0). The plugin is designed to prevent players from falling into the void and getting stuck. Developed and maintained by **MilkAndCookiz**, it offers essential features for safe gameplay in Minecraft Bedrock Edition.

Contributions and improvements are welcome as the plugin evolves with new features and configuration options.


## Objective
* Automatically teleport players to the spawn when they fall below Y-level 0.
* Provide an easily customizable `config.yml` for user-defined teleport messages.
* Support the latest PocketMine-MP releases.
